# Variables, Types, Expressions, and Statemetns

## Primary Uses of the Console

- Can be used from a programming point of view or a 'user' point of view.
- Users use the console to interact with programs. 
- Often useful to have the console print values of computations or objects in your programs.
  - Helps determine intermediate values.
    - Aids the debugging process.

## Variables and Expressions: Giving Names and Values to Things

### Giving Names to Things

- We reference things by using variables.
- Not exactly the same thing as a 'variable' in Math.
  - In programming, `=` is an 'assignment' as opposed to an equivalence.
  - We call the thing to the right of an equal sign an *expression* with a *value*.
  - The only thing that you are allowed to have to the left of an equal sign is the name of a variable.  

**An expression is a line of code that can be reduced to a value.**

## Introducing variables

### Objects Are Things That Can Be Manipulated

- In python, everything is an object, and h as the following:
  - A type
    - Tells you the data/values/attributes/etc.
  - A set of operations
    - Commands that you can tell the object to do.

### Objects Have Names

- Names are *variables*.
- Used to refer to objects

**A variable is used to bind a name to an object. A variable name refers to a particular object.**

### Allowed Object Names

- Must begin with a letter or an underscore `_`.
- Other characters can be letters, numbers, or an underscore.
- Case sensitive.
- Of any length.

**It's good practice to limit lines of code to 80 characters for readability purposes. Try to make names as concise as possible.**

**Note:** Python has a vew reserved words that can't be used as variable names. Many editors will highlight these special keywords.
